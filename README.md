Welcome to the Django Jazz Chord Djenerator. Choose the number of chords you want and the key and start writing.



The Django Jazz Chord Djenerator uses a markov-chain to produce a chord progression of any given length in whatever key the user desires.

This is achieved by changing the data that is used in the markov-chain depending on the users choice. The markov-chain then randomly selects a chord in the key the user selected. The markov-chain then determines the next chord depending on the relationship between the current chord and the next chord and repeats this process until the desired number of chords is reached.
